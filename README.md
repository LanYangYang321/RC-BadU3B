## 🔍 Before You Replicate

This repository contains **two subprojects**:

1. **Remote-Controlled BadUSB**

   * Consists of an ultra-compact USB receiver and an ESP32-based transmitter.
   * 👉 See [RMTbadusb](https://github.com/LanYangYang321/RC-BadU3B/tree/main/RMTbadusb) for details.

2. **Local BadUSB**

   * Features an SD-card module for storing and executing payloads locally.
   * 👉 See [localBadUSB](https://github.com/LanYangYang321/RC-BadU3B/tree/main/localBadUSB) for details.

> **Note:** Reproducing this project requires **PCB soldering expertise**, especially QFN-package soldering on the Remote-Controlled BadUSB—a challenging task for beginners.

## 💻 Software

* **Development Environment:** Arduino IDE
* **Structure:**

  * Two folders, one per subproject.
  * The remote-trojan code leverages my own open-source RAT, [tetrojan](https://github.com/LanYangYang321/tetrojan).

> **Usage:** Simply flash the corresponding `.ino` file to your ESP32 via the Arduino IDE.
